  <h3> Problem Description </h3>
  The number of coronavirus cases in the United States has continued to grow
  exponentially in the past few months, topping the chart globally. Abiding by
  the CDC guidelines, most people are wearing face masks, keeping their social
  distances, and restaurants along with other entertainment facilities have
  delayed opening. However, the nation’s cases are still soaring. As members of
  the community, we want to address this concern by bringing in some measures
  other countries have attempted to efficiently “flatten the curve.” For
  instance, in China, COVID-testing applications and softwares are available
  in most social media platforms. There are ways people can not only get
  “self-tested” by filling out a survey and purchasing basic preventive
  products such as face masks and gloves, but can also gain access to
  first-hand, reliable sources of information on surrounding cases and news by
  neighborhood. As students, we fully acknowledge our limited ability to
  outright prevent the spread of viruses. However, we want to build such a
  platform as a means of making information more transparent among American
  citizens. Existing web applications for tracking COVID cases have been
  limited. For example, the
  <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map">
    Johns Hopkins University COVID tracker </a> focuses
  on COVID tracing. Its emphasis on states and territories make it more
  difficult for users to visualize in comparison to their local neighborhoods.
  Amazon offers face masks and other preventative products to purchase, yet
  their product offerings are limited, with no source to compile and contrast
  similar products from multiple websites. Furthermore,
  <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">
    MAYO Clinic </a> provides a
  short survey for users to self-test for COVID-19. Resources like these are
  scattered in a manner that is hard to locate, and thus, can serve as an
  inconvenience for people desperately looking for help. For these reasons, we
  want to build a platform that serves as the center of information, where
  people can gain access to different types of COVID-19 related, first-hand
  resources.

  <h3> App Description </h3>
  This website is targeted towards anyone, most likely within the United
  States, to gain access to information that is pertinent to them. For our
  users, there are many options available once they are on the site. The main
  functionality will include the ability to visualize their neighborhood’s
  latest COVID-19 updates. Specifically, how many people are infected and where
  they are located. The site will also provide other functions such as allowing
  users to purchase products used for preventative measures. We will allow them
  to search for a compilation of different products to purchase at a low rate.
  We will also be linking additional resources such as the latest news,
  potential rumors about COVID-19 related news, as well as self-testing surveys
  from different verified healthcare providers.
  Because all of the current available data for COVID confirmed cases by zip
  codes are compiled individually by state, we plan on compiling all of these
  data together so that users are able to more easily track and monitor their
  health within local neighborhoods. Some examples of these data by state are
  listed as follows:
  <li><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-data-insights/">
    Virginia </a> </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics">
    Illinois </a> </li>
  <li><a href="https://scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/sc-cases-county-zip-code-covid-19">
    South Carolina </a> </li>
    We attempt to provide assistance to individuals in the United States so
    that they can find information more easily. By compiling multiple data
    sources ranging from the number of cases in their local communities to
    purchasing face masks, we want to provide a platform where individuals can
    better monitor their health before it is too late. Hospitals are packed
    most of the time, and we hope that if possible, to expand on this project
    by adding a section where people can search for their local hospital
    openings when they have infected the disease.
    Some other features we plan to implement include links to different
    surveys, such as MAYO clinic’s certified survey where individuals can
    self-test for potential COVID infections. This will be especially helpful
    for those unable to physically attend a testing center to have a
    preliminary idea of potential infection.
